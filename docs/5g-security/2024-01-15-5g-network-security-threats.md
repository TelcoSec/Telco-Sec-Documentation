# 5G Network Security: Threats and Mitigations

## Executive Summary

The deployment of 5G networks introduces significant security challenges that require comprehensive understanding and proactive mitigation strategies. This research paper analyzes the evolving threat landscape in 5G telecommunications infrastructure and provides actionable recommendations for network operators, security professionals, and regulatory bodies.

## Introduction

Fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology represents a fundamental shift in telecommunications architecture, introducing new capabilities such as ultra-low latency, massive machine-type communications, and enhanced mobile broadband. However, these advancements also introduce new security vulnerabilities and attack vectors that traditional security measures may not adequately address.

### Research Objectives

4. Provide implementation guidelines for network operators

## 5G Network Architecture Overview

### Core Network Components

5G networks consist of several key components that introduce unique security considerations:
